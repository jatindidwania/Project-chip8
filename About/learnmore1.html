<h1>About Chip-8</h1>

<h2>So "What's a Chip-8?"</h2>
<p>Chip-8 is a simple, interpreted, programming language which was first used on some do-it-yourself computer systems in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
The COSMAC VIP, DREAM 6800, and ETI 660 computers are a few examples.
These computers typically were designed to use a television as a display, had between 1 and 4K of RAM, and used a 16-key hexadecimal keypad for input.
The interpreter took up only 512 bytes of memory, and programs, which were entered into the computer in hexadecimal, were even smaller.
</p>

<h2>Who is the creator</h2>
<p>CHIP-8 was created by RCA engineer Joe Weisbecker in 1977 for the COSMAC VIP microcomputer.
It was intended as a simpler way to make small programs and games for the computer.
Instead of using machine language for the VIP’s CDP1802 processor, you could type in simple hexadecimal instructions
 (with the VIP’s hex keypad) that resembled machine code, but which was actually interpreted on the fly by a small program.<br><br>
CHIP-8 soon spread to other computers, like the Finnish Telmac 1800, the Australian DREAM 6800, ETI-660 and MicroBee, and the Canadian ACE VDU.
 By 1984 the support for CHIP-8 petered out. However, in 1990 it had a renaissance on the HP48 graphing calculators with CHIP-48 and the now-famous
 SUPER-CHIP extension with higher resolution.</p>
